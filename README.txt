This is a repository with the files necessary to transmit a live video feed from a Raspberry Pi with a Raspicam module.

Strobe folder - This is the media player and should be in the same folder as the webserver.

nginx.conf - Is the configuration file of the HTTP server.

index.html - Is the actual page that provides ONLY the video player for running the stream.
